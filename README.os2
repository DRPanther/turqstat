The locale support for EMX is quite limited at the moment. Currently EMX
0.9d only supports these locales:

  Country       Locale
  -------       ------
  France        FRAN
  Germany       GERM
  Italy         ITAL
  Spain         SPAI
  U.K.          UK
  U.S.A         USA

To enable a locale, set the environment variable LANG to the appropriate
value, e.g SET LANG=UK
