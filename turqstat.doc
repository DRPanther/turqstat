LICENSE

This software is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2
(GNU GPL), as can be found in the accompanying file COPYING, with the
following addition:

This program may be linked against any Fidonet or other message base access
sources or binary libraries that does not comply with the GNU GPL, as long
as their inclusion does not compromise the free distribution of the main
source code. It must also be possible to compile the main source without
using these access sources or binary libraries (e.g with conditional
pre-processor directives) and still get a working binary.

Binaries created by linking against such message base access code must be
freely distributable and usable by anyone (i.e it is not enough to warrant
"non-commercial use only"). If this cannot be complied with, then no such
binaries must be distributed.

Even with this exception, licensing new message base access sources under GNU
GPL is encouraged.

This program may also be linked against any GUI library that meets the
criteria for Debian free software guidelines (DFSG), including, but not
limited to, Troll Tech's Q Public License. You may also distribute binaries
linked to commercial or non-free versions of Troll Tech's Qt GUI library, as
long as you also distribute any changes you do to these sources. Furthermore,
the file mytime.cpp derives from the EMX library, which has this license: You
are allowed to change and copy the emx library sources if you keep the
copyright message intact.

USAGE (COMMAND LINE VERSION)

Turquoise SuperStat reads the contents of a Fidonet message area in one of its
supported formats, or standard Usenet news spools, and creates statistics
about this:

 * Quoter blacklist.
 * Toplist of senders.
 * Toplist of original content per message.
 * Toplist of Fidonet nets (Fidonet only).
 * Toplist of Internet topdomains.
 * Toplist of receivers (Fidonet only).
 * Toplist of subjects.
 * Toplist of used software.
 * Postings by weekday.
 * Postings by time of day.

Any of the statistic subjects may be turned off. The statistics is stored in a
text file.

Turquoise SuperStat is entirely command line driven, and the format is this:

  turqstat [options] outputfile areapath(s)

where areapath(s) is the path to the message area file, or the message base
number (depends on the message base format selected). Several area
paths/message base numbers may be specified to do combined statistics for
several areas. Outputfile is the path to the text file that the statistics are
to be written to.

These extra options are available (please note that all options must precede
file names and message base paths):

Data selection:

-d <days>
   Selects the number of days back to count messages from. The default is 0,
   which mean count all messages.

-n <num>
   Selects the maximum number of entries in the toplists. The default is 15. 0
   indicates no limit.

-r <range>
   Selects a range of dates and times for which statistics will be gathered.
   The range is given on the form [yyyymmdd[Thhmmss]]-[yyyymmdd[Thhmmss]].
   Examples: 20000101T000000-20001231T235959 is all of 2000, -20010101 is
   everything before (not including) January 1st, 2001, and 20010101- is
   everything from (and including) January 1st, 2001.

Input selection:

-a <path>
   Selects the message base path for the FDAPX/w, MyPoint and taanstafl
   message bases, which have all message bases in the same files.

-s Selects Squish style message base (default). The areapath parameter should
   be the base name of the Squish files, or the name of any of the data files
   (suffix is automatically removed).

-m Selects FTSC *.MSG style message base. The areapath parameter should be the
   directory in which the messagebase resides.

-o Selects Opus *.MSG style message base. The areapath parameter should be the
   directory in which the messagebase resides.

-j Select JAM style message base. The areapath parameter should be the base
   name of the JAM files, or the name of any of the data files (suffix is
   automatically removed).

-f Selects FDAPX/w style message base. Requires the use of the -a parameter to
   select the message base path. The areapath parameter should be the area
   number (1-1999).

-t Selects tanstaafl style message base. Requires the use of the -a parameter
   to select the message base path. The areapath parameter should be the area
   number (1-1999).

-p Selects MyPoint style message base. Requires the use of the -a parameter to
   select the message base path (the AREAS subdirectory). The areapath
   parameter should be the area number.

-u Select a Usenet news spool. The areapath parameter should be the path in
   which the news article files reside.

You can only retrieve statistics from one kind of message area per invocation.

Toplist selection:

-Q Turns the quoter blacklist off (default is on).

-W Turns the writer toplist off (default is on).

-O Turns the original content per message toplist off (default is on).

-N Turns the top nets list off (default is on) (Fidonet only).

-T Turns the top Internet topdomain list on/off. For Usenet, the default is
   on, and this switch turns it off. For Fidonet, the default is off, and this
   switch turns it on, but only if there are any RFC gated messages detected.

-R Turns the recipient toplist off (default is on) (Fidonet only).

-S Turns the subject toplist off (default is on).

-P Turns the program toplist off (default is on).

-H Turns the hourly posting statistics off (default is on).

-D Turns the daily posting statistics off (default is on).

-V Turns the display of versions in the program toplist off (default is
   on).

Output options:

-A Display all numbers in toplists (default is off).

-L Use the locale defined date format (default is to use the ISO-8601
   format, as per Swedish and EU standards). Please note that the support
   for local date formats varies with platform and compiler.

-C <charset>
   Selects character encoding to use for the created report files. The
   character encoding name can be specified by either its Fidonet or MIME
   name. Default for the Win32 and OS/2 versions is IBMPC (codepage 437),
   and for all other versions LATIN-1 (iso-8859-1).

The options can be aggregated on the command line, for example:

  turqstat -mWRSPHDON d:\text\output.txt d:\msgbase\thisarea

will create quoter blacklist (only) from the *.MSG message base in the
d:\msgbase\thisarea directory. The options are case sensitive.

  turqstat -?

will give you a quick help screen with an overview of the available options.


USAGE (GUI VERSION)

The GUI version of Turquoise SuperStat has the same capabilities as the
command line version, but with all the functions available via an easy-to-use
GUI. The GUI version is built using Qt.

The main window of the GUI version contains statistics about the currently
loaded set of data, which is initially empty. To load statistics, you need to
use the menus, as described below.

 File - Open message base

Reads statistics for a message base and displays statistics in the main
window.

 File - Open news group

Reads statistics for a news group on a news server and displays statistics
in the main window.

 File - Clear data

Clears all loaded data and resets the displayed statistics.

 File - Save report

Saves a report of the currently loaded set of statistics to a text file, in
the same format as the command line version uses.

 File - Exit

Leaves the program.

 Edit - Set start date

Lets you select how many days back to load statistics when using File - Open
message base.

 Show

This menu displays the various toplists that are available. Please see the
section on the command line version for more detailed descriptions.


TIME STAMPS

To calculate which messages are to be covered by the statisticts or not, the
arrival time is used, since messages can take different amounts of time to
arrive. This ensures that if you each week take statistics over the last seven
days, you will always get all messages that arrived during the last week, not
missing messages which happen to have taken half a week to arrive.

However, some message base formats, notably FTSC *.MSG and tanstaafl message
bases, as well as news group data retrieved over NNTP, lack an arrival time
stamp, so in these cases the date written stamp will be used instead. For
local Usenet news spools, the file create date is considered to be the arrival
time.


USENET IN FIDONET FORMAT

Turquoise contains functionality for handling Usenet messages in Fidonet
format conforming to (de facto) standards in use. Control lines as specified
in FSC-0035 (REPLYADDR) are handled, and the address in them are used instead
of the Fidonet address. Furthermore, RFC headers written directly as Fidonet
control lines, or prefixed with "RFC-", both commonly occuring, are handled.

CREDITS

Thanks to Dan Gohman <gohmandj@mrs.umn.edu> for help with porting to GNU C++
3.0.


REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPILATION

The program was developed under OS/2 using EMX 0.9d/GNU C/C++ 2.8.1, Debian
2.2 with gcc 2.95.4 and Win32 with Mingw32 (gcc 2.95.2).

The GUI version requires Qt version 2.3 or later to be installed.

To create a Debian package you need to install Debian's developer packages,
including debhelper and fakeroot (if you do not want to compile as root). At
the prompt, issue "fakeroot debian/rules binary" (without the quotes). If you
also want to create Debian's archive control files, use dpkg-buildpackage.
