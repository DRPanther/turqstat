LICENSE

This software is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2,
as can be found in the accompanying file COPYING, with the following addition:

This program may be linked against any Fidonet message base access sources or
binary libraries that does not comply with the GNU GPL, as long as their
inclusion does not compromise the free distribution of the main source code.
It must also be possible to compile the main source without using these access
sources or binary libraries (e.g with conditional pre-processor directives)
and still get a working binary.

Binaries created by linking against such message base access code must be
freely distributable and usable by anyone (i.e it is not enough to warrant
"non-commercial use only"). If this cannot be complied with, then no such
binaries must be distributed.

Even with this exception, licensing new message base access sources under GNU
GPL is encouraged.

USEAGE

Turquoise SuperStat reads the contents of a Fidonet message area in one of its
supported formats, or standard Usenet news spools, and creates statistics
about this:

 * Quoter blacklist.
 * Toplist of senders.
 * Toplist of original content per message.
 * Toplist of Fidonet nets (Fidonet only).
 * Toplist of Internet topdomains.
 * Toplist of receivers (Fidonet only).
 * Toplist of subjects.
 * Toplist of used software.
 * Postings by weekday.
 * Postings by time of day.

Any of the statistic subjects may be turned off. The statistics is stored in a
text file.

Turquoise SuperStat is entirely command line driven, and the format is this:

  turqstat [options] outputfile areapath(s)

where areapath(s) is the path to the message area file, or the message base
number (depends on the message base format selected). Several area
paths/message base numbers may be specified to do combined statistics for
several areas. Outputfile is the path to the text file that the statistics are
to be written to.

These extra options are available:

Data selection:

-d <days>
   Selects the number of days back to count messages from. The default is 0,
   which mean count all messages.

-n <num>
   Selects the maximum number of entries in the toplists. The default is 15. 0
   indicates no limit.

Input selection:

-a <path>
   Selects the message base path for the FDAPX/w, MyPoint and taanstafl
   message bases, which have all message bases in the same files.

-s Selects Squish style message base (default). The areapath parameter should
   be the base name of the Squish files, or the name of any of the data files
   (suffix is automatically removed).

-m Selects FTSC *.MSG style message base. The areapath parameter should be the
   directory in which the messagebase resides.

-o Selects Opus *.MSG style message base. The areapath parameter should be the
   directory in which the messagebase resides.

-j Select JAM style message base. The areapath parameter should be the base
   name of the JAM files, or the name of any of the data files (suffix is
   automatically removed).

-f Selects FDAPX/w style message base. Requires the use of the -a parameter to
   select the message base path. The areapath parameter should be the area
   number (1-1999).

-t Selects tanstaafl style message base. Requires the use of the -a parameter
   to select the message base path. The areapath parameter should be the area
   number (1-1999).

-p Selects MyPoint style message base. Requires the use of the -a parameter to
   select the message base path (the AREAS subdirectory). The areapath
   parameter should be the area number.

-u Select a Usenet news spool. The areapath parameter should be the path in
   which the news article files reside.

Toplist selection:

-Q Turns the quoter blacklist off (default is on).

-W Turns the writer toplist off (default is on).

-O Turns the original content per message toplist off (default is on).

-N Turns the top nets list off (default is on) (Fidonet only).

-T Turns the top Internet topdomain list on/off. For Usenet, the default is
   on, and this switch turns it off. For Fidonet, the default is off, and this
   switch turns it on, but only if there are any RFC gated messages detected.

-R Turns the recipient toplist off (default is on) (Fidonet only).

-S Turns the subject toplist off (default is on).

-P Turns the program toplist off (default is on).

-H Turns the hourly posting statistics off (default is on).

-D Turns the daily posting statistics off (default is on).

-V Turns the display of versions in the program toplist off (default is
   on).

Output options:

-A Display all numbers in toplists (default is off).

-L Use the locale defined date format (default is to use the ISO-8601
   format, as per Swedish and EU standards). Please note that the support
   for local date formats varies with platform and compiler.

The options can be aggregated on the command line, for example:

  turqstat -mWRSPHDON d:\text\output.txt d:\msgbase\thisarea

will create quoter blacklist (only) from the *.MSG message base in the
d:\msgbase\thisarea directory. The options are case sensitive.

  turqstat -?

will give you a quick help screen with an overview of the available options.


TIME STAMPS

To calculate which messages are to be covered by the statisticts or not, the
arrival time is used, since messages can take different amounts of time to
arrive. This ensures that if you each week take statistics over the last seven
days, you will always get all messages that arrived during the last week, not
missing messages which happen to have taken half a week to arrive.

However, some message base formats, notably FTSC *.MSG and tanstaafl message
bases, lack an arrival time stamp, so in these cases the date written stamp
will be used instead. For Usenet news spools, the file create date is
considered to be the arrival time.

Since the time calculations are using the standard C library functions, there
are certain problems involved with timezones. As far possible, all timezone
functions are turned off, but this does not work on all platforms (CygWin on
Win32 is one example). But, turning timezones off will yield file timestamps
(used on Usenet spools) in GMT. This is a problem, and if anyone has any good
ideas on how to solve it, please contact me.

The Unix distribution consists of a .tar.gz containing all the sources listed
above, plus the documentation files. No binaries are included. It also
contains a debian subdirectory which has control files for creating a Debian
binary package.


REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPILATION

The program was developed under OS/2 using EMX 0.9d/GNU C/C++ 2.8.1 and Debian
2.2 with gcc 2.95.2, and has also been tested under Mingw32 (gcc 2.95.2). It
should compile using any standard C++ compiler. The program must probably be
rewritten to support "big endian" processors.
