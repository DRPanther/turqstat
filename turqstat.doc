LICENSE

This software is distributed under the GNU General Public License version
2, as can be found in the accompanying file COPYING, with the following
addition:

This program may be linked against any Fidonet message base access sources
or binary libraries that does not comply with the GNU GPL, as long as their
inclusion does not compromise the free distribution of the main source
code. It must also be possible to compile the main source without using
these access sources or binary libraries (e.g with conditional
pre-processor directives) and still get a working binary.

Binaries created by linking against such message base access code must be
freely distributable and usable by anyone (i.e it is not enough to warrant
"non-commercial use only"). If this cannot be complied with, then no such
binaries must be distributed.

Even with this exception, licensing new message base access sources under
GNU GPL is encouraged.

USEAGE

Turquoise SuperStat reads the contents of a Fidonet message area in one of
its supported formats, and creates statistics about this:

 * Quoter blacklist.
 * Toplist of senders.
 * Toplist of receivers.
 * Toplist of subjects.
 * Toplist of used software.
 * Postings by weekday.
 * Postings by time of day.

Any of the statistic subjects may be turned off. The statistics is stored
in a text file.

Turquoise SuperStat is entirely command line driven, and the format is this:

  turqstat [options] areapath outputfile

where areapath is the path to the message area file or directory (depends
on the message base format selected), and outputfile is the path to the
text file that the statistics are to be written to.

These extra options are available:

-d <days>
   Selects the number of days back to count messages from. The default is
   0, which mean count all messages. The message arrival time is used, not
   the message creation date stamp.

-n <num>
   Selects the maximum number of entries in the toplists. The default is 15.
   0 indicates no limit.

-a <num>
   Selects the area number for the FDAPX/w and MyPoint message bases, which
   has all messages in the same files.

-s Selects Squish style message base (default). The areapath parameter should
   be the base name of the Squish files.

-m Selects FTSC *.MSG style message base. The areapath parameter should be the
   directory in which the messagebase resides. This message base type lacks
   arrival dates, so the -d parameter will work on write dates.

-o Selects Opus *.MSG style message base. The areapath parameter should be the
   directory in which the messagebase resides. Opus *.MSG does have arrival
   dates.

-j Select JAM style message base. The areapath parameter should be the base
   name of the JAM files.

-f Selects FDAPX/w style message base. Requires the use of the -a parameter
   to select the area number (1-1999). The areapath parameter should be the
   directory in which the message base files resides.

-p Selects MyPoint style message base. Requires the use of the -a parameter to
   select the area number. The areapath parameter should be the path to the
   MyPoint AREAS subdirectory.

-Q Turns the quoter blacklist off (default is on).

-W Turns the writer toplist off (default is on).

-R Turns the recipient toplist off (default is on).

-S Turns the subject toplist off (default is on).

-P Turns the program toplist off (default is on).

-H Turns the hourly posting statistics off (default is on).

-D Turns the daily posting statistics off (default is on).

-V Turns the display of versions in the program toplist off (default is
   on).

-N Display all numbers in toplists (default is off).

The options can be aggregated on the command line, for example:

  turqstat -mWRSPHD d:\msgbase\thisarea d:\text\output.txt

will create quoter blacklist (only) from the *.MSG message base in the
d:\msgbase\thisarea directory. The options are case sensitive.

will give you a quick help screen with an overview of the available
options.

REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPILATION

The program was developed under OS/2 using EMX 0.9c/GNU C/C++ 2.7.2.1 and
Debian 2.1 with egcs 2.91.66, and has also been tested under CygWin b20. It
should compile using any standard C++ compiler. The program must probably be
rewritten to support "big endian" processors.
