This software is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2,
which on Debian systems can be found in the /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL
file, with the following additions:

This program may be linked against any Fidonet or other message base access
sources or binary libraries that does not comply with the GNU GPL, as long
as their inclusion does not compromise the free distribution of the main
source code. It must also be possible to compile the main source without
using these access sources or binary libraries (e.g with conditional
pre-processor directives) and still get a working binary.

Binaries created by linking against such message base access code must be
freely distributable and usable by anyone (i.e it is not enough to warrant
"non-commercial use only"). If this cannot be complied with, then no such
binaries must be distributed.

Even with this exception, licensing new message base access sources under GNU
GPL is encouraged.

This program may also be linked against any GUI library that meets the
criteria for Debian free software guidelines (DFSG), including, but not
limited to, Troll Tech's Q Public License. You may also distribute binaries
linked to commercial or non-free versions of Troll Tech's Qt GUI library, as
long as you also distribute any changes you do to these sources. Furthermore,
the file mytime.cpp derives from the EMX library, which has this license: You
are allowed to change and copy the emx library sources if you keep the
copyright message intact.
