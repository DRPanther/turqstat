This software is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2,
which on Debian systems can be found in the /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL
file, with the following additions:

This program may be linked against any Fidonet message base access sources or
binary libraries that does not comply with the GNU GPL, as long as their
inclusion does not compromise the free distribution of the main source code.
It must also be possible to compile the main source without using these access
sources or binary libraries (e.g with conditional pre-processor directives)
and still get a working binary.

Binaries created by linking against such message base access code must be
freely distributable and usable by anyone (i.e it is not enough to warrant
"non-commercial use only"). If this cannot be complied with, then no such
binaries must be distributed.

Even with this exception, licensing new message base access sources under GNU
GPL is encouraged.

This program may also be linked against any GUI library that meets the Open
Source criteria, including, but not limited to, Troll Tech's Q Public License.
Furthermore, the file mytime.cpp derives from the EMX library, which has this
license: You are allowed to change and copy the emx library sources if you
keep the copyright message intact.
